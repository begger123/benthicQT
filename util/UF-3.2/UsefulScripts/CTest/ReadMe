These are example scripts for setting up testing.

In general you will need to:
1) Set up directories called ctest, ctest-scripts, cron-logs.
2) Copy the contents of ctest_scripts to the directory called ctest_scripts that you made.
3) Checkout UF from the SVN into UF.
4) Change the paths to reflect where you have put UF, UFNightlyBuild and UFContinuousBuild.
5) my.crontab shows some crontab entries. Edit the paths in this.
6) Do crontab my.crontab
7) And everything should run.

Note: Make sure that you do not use your development tree for testing.

For Windows the procedure is similar, except you use the scripts UF_continuous.bat, UF_continuous.script, UF_nightly.bat, UF_nightly.cfg. In Scheduled tasks, you have to set up tasks to call the batch files: UF_continuous.bat and UF_nightly.bat
