Data/Plane.txt and  Data/SplitSphere.txt are copied to bin/DTMData in the build directory.

To construct the structured grids used in volume estimation:
bin/DTMConverter bin/DTMData/Plane.txt Plane.bin
bin/DTMConverter bin/DTMData/SplitSphere.txt SplitSphere.bin
This will produce Plane.bin, Plane.txt and SplitSphere.bin, SplitSphere.txt in your current directory.

Then estimate the volume by doing:
bin/DTMVolume ./Plane.bin ./SplitSphere.bin
This will produce:
FIIK0.vtp - no cuboids.
FIIK1.vtp - all cuboids.
FIIK2.vtp - cuboids lying above or on the reference surface.
FIIK3.vtp - cuboids lying below or on the reference surface.
FIIK4.vtp - cuboids lying above and below reference surface.

Run PraView and load FIIK0.vtp, then you can step through the frames.

You can look at the data in the structured grids by doing this:
bin/ReadDTM SplitSphere.bin some_file
It will produce a file containing all the scalars in a human-readable format.
